 I. Introduction
 ---------------
     Epsilon Fighter is a two-dimensional space action/arcade game set in
 the style of an old DOS computer game. The graphics are purposefully
 pixelated and the music is meant to sound like an old primitive MIDI
 sound card. The focus of the game is gameplay: story, action, and all the
 other subtle game aspects that don't get much attention in the world of
 flashy 3D graphics and sound.

 III. Story
 ----------
 IMC Headquarters. April 29, 2486. 4:32 am local time.
 
     " Sorry to wake you, sir, the computer is reporting that it has lost
 contact with Colony 12."
     " Colony 12? That's one of the deep space research stations, right?"
	 " Yes sir, on the southern continent of Galanti II."
	 " That's far away leuitenant. I wouldn't be alarmed until the tetriary
 contact window has passed. Not all communications makes it that far
 across the galaxy you know? Gotta try a couple times."
     " Yes, I understand that, sir, but the tetriary contact window has
 passed."
     " How long ago?"
	 " Two days."
	 " These systems have backups of backups of backups, so the computers
 couldn't have failed. Did you check for any instellear object interfering?"
     " There was what looked like an ivory shower earlier this morning in
 the Ivory solar system."
     " Where's that?"
	 " Less than a half lightyear from Galanti and Colony 12."
	 " So we wait. That probably ruined the signals coming through."
	 " No sir, it only looked like a meteor shower."
	 " What are you trying to say son?"
	 " It was moving at three quarters lightspeed."

 IV. Installation
 ----------------
    Installation of Epsilon Fighter varies depending on the package
 downloaded. If you downloaded the source package, you will need
 a C++ compiler such as GNU GCC 3.1. The game may or may not compile
 under GNU GCC 2.x. Compiling also requires the Simple DirectMedia
 Library (SDL, www.libsdl.org) and SDL_image (www.libsdl.org). SDL
 is needed for the graphics and input and SDL_image is used to load
 PNG files. If you are compiling SDL_image yourself, ensure PNG
 support is enabled, which requires the installation of zlib and
 libpng.
    If you are installing a binary package, simply run the installer.
    All data files are installed in $(PREFIX)/etc/epsilonfighter/ and
 all user-specific configuration files are stored in
 $(HOME)/.epsilonfighter/.
